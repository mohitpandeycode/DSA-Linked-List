# About Linked List by MohitðŸš€

# Introduction Of Linked List:ðŸ˜‰
- Linked List is a linear data structure, in which elements are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers. Linked List forms a series of connected nodes, where each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

- In Python we have not worry about Memory Management, because in Python the Memory management is automatic!

# types of Linked List:ðŸ¤”

## Singly Linked List:-
- In a singly linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence. Traversing a singly linked list is done in a forward direction.

## Doubly Linked List:-
- In a doubly linked list, each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes. This allows for traversal in both forward and backward directions, but it requires additional memory for the backward reference.

## Circular Linked List:-
- In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the head node, creating a circular structure. It can be either singly or doubly linked.

# Operations in Linked List:ðŸ˜®

### Insertion:-
- Insert any element in a first, Last or After any element in the list.

### deletion:-
- Delete element from first, Last or any element.

### Searching:-
- Traversing in the list to find any element existing in a list.

### Check Empty or not:-
- Checking if the list is Empty or not.

# Advantages of Linked Lists:ðŸ˜Š
- Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically, as memory allocation is done at runtime.
- Insertion and Deletion: Adding or removing elements from a linked list is efficient, especially for large lists.
- Flexibility: Linked lists can be easily reorganized and modified without requiring a contiguous block of memory.

# Disadvantages of Linked Lists:ðŸ˜¥
- Random Access: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not allow direct access to elements by index. Traversal is required to reach a specific node.
- Extra Memory: Linked lists require additional memory for storing the pointers, compared to arrays.

# Conclusion:
Linked lists are versatile data structures that provide dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations. Understanding the basics of linked lists is essential for any programmer or computer science enthusiast. With this knowledge, you can implement linked lists to solve various problems and expand your understanding of data structures and algorithms.
